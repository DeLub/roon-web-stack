# roon-web-model

A simple package to hold the `.d.ts` typing the common part of this repo.

Nothing more, nothing less.

Used as a devDependency to ensure `types` coherence between the [API](../../app/roon-web-api/README.md), the [client](../roon-web-client/README.md) and the [web app](../../app/roon-web-ng-client/README.md).

**This module includes sources copied from [Stevenic/roon-kit](https://github.com/Stevenic/roon-kit), see in the [README](./src/roon-kit/README.md) in the `roon-kit` folder for more info.**
