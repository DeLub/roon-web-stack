# Stack choices

Some thoughts on the `stack` and `architecture` choice:
- for the [frontend](#frontend-app)
- for the [backend](#backend-api-proxy)

## Frontend app

### Why Angular?
 As stated in the [README](../README.md), I've not been directly involved in `frontend` development recently.  
 I've fixed some bugs on `react` enterprise app, to help teams I was working with as a `backend` engineer.  
 Nothing more in the last 7 years.  
 
When I've decided to start coding a `roon` web client, I first looked at the `react` world. 
After all, even if it was not brand new, it still looked like the cool kid of the gang. 
Then I started reading about the state of the art of `react` development, started to read `Next.js` doc... and gave up ðŸ¤·.  
There was nothing here I didn't understand (both regarding *the why* and *the how*), but the extra complexity brought nothing to my actual use case.

At this point, I also had already lost way too much time (from my point of view) on issues with tooling while setting up the `API` part of this repo.   
Simplifying the stack was a very welcome thing.  
That was fun (or not?) to build a `monorepo` in `typescript`.   
Any `frontend` tech lead would certainly laugh at the result, but it was part of the game: starting form scratch with these technologies out of my core expertise.   

All these little frustrations made the hype stuffs looked less attractive: 

*give me something that works, which includes tooling, a stable component library, and that won't be abandoned for the next new thing in the 6 coming months.*  

If the project finds its audience, I don't want to get stuck in a technological dead end implying a full rewrite in two years.

So despite my initial curiosity for the vast diversity of the web development universe, I've had a look at the release notes of the `Angular 17` version that were still hot, just baked (all that project started in the first days of december 2023).  
And what I read made a lot of sens:
- `Signals` are a nice way to deal with change propagation (especially `computed` ones) 
- The new `control flow` syntaxes are nice and clean
- `Angular Material` has almost everything I need out of the box (both high level components and low level recipes via `cdk`)
- Documentation is clear, maintained by the team and kind of exhaustive, with live code exemples if needed ([and the new beta one is gorgeous](https://angular.dev/)). 
- `Angular` has both the reputation to make breaking changes and to provide tools to ease the migration. I remember all the drama that happened when `Angular 2` launched, breaking everything (we were starting a project with the first `beta` of `Angular 2`). It seems the lesson has been learned.

So angular it is.

So bad for `vue`, `svelte`, `htmx`, and all the other ones I don't even know... maybe next time. I wanted to start `coding`, and wasn't making a choice to build an internal `stack` used by dozens of devs.

Oh, `karma` is deprecated... but the `Angular cli` stills generates everything with it...  
`javascript` ecosystem will always be `javascript` ecosystem... I guess...  

... ðŸ¤· ...  

*is there a blog post to plug `jest` on an `Angular 17` app...* 

Oh `javascript`...

### Why Sass?

It comes with `Angular Material`, that was a massive point in the decision to go with `Anuglar`.

So `Sass` it is.

By the way, thanks `W3C` for `flexbox`! I've never liked writing `CSS`, but it's way less painful with `flexbox`!

I know about non-semantic `css`.  
I agree, at least on paper, as I've never tried this approach myself (but good people, outside the [`tailwind`](https://tailwindcss.com) team, agreed too).  
I didn't want to buy a [`tailwind`](https://tailwindcss.com) license.    
So I've written my `css`, via `sass`, the old fashion way... and I'm ok with it: this is a one human (for now) project, with a dozen components, I'm not a web agency. Guess I'll try that another time, or later in this project lifecycle ðŸ¤·.


### Why yarn?

If you're still reading, you know now that I think tooling must be stable and efficient. Especially for a project of this size (things change at organisation scale).  
From my understanding, `npm` had matured enough to be self-sufficient.  
But my first attempts with `workspaces` didn't produce anything.  

I've read quickly about `Lerna` and `Turbo`, **but**, the lib I've finally inlined in this repo ([Stevenic/roon-kit](https://github.com/Stevenic/roon-kit)) was built with `Lerna`, and couldn't be updated to the last `Lerna` version, because of major breaking changes... so I resisted once again to include yet another tool as neither the size of this `monorepo` nor it's scope could justify it.  

I then applied the base rule of this project: no more than one hour to discover, try or evaluate, then back to well-known solution.  
`yarn` is maintained by a big player, it won't disappear soon, and I managed to have something working(ish) almost instantly.  
I guess, `pnpm` and the new kids on the block, `vite` (that is used by `Angular` for the dev server) and `bun` (which is way more than just a build tool) will be tried in another project.

## Backend API proxy

### Why an API proxy?

The main benefits are listed in the [API README](../app/roon-web-api).

But let's resume them here:
- a unique connection point with `roon`: if you want 10 `web clients` instances, it's just one `extension`. It's also a unique point where this connection lifecycle is managed.
- subscribing to all events for everything (zones, outputs, queues) and broadcasting these events was the best way both to simplify the `web client` development and to ensure fluid operation (when the displayed zone is changed in the browser, nothing to do, it's instant)
- I've strongly believed in [CQRS](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html), as an architecture pattern since I've been introduced to it. For this project, it was a way to prepare the development of futur features (like custom actions), while offering a clear separation of concerns between the publication of the `states` and the mutation of the `states`. Still, it's not a complete implementation: the way that `roon` API deals with music selection in `API` by `loading`, after `browsing` an `item` does not fit in this pattern. There's a rumor saying that software development is an engineering of tradeoffs
- Typing and simplifying the `API` was a big motivation: at the end, there 7 operations in 1 `endpoint`, way less that all what is exposed by `roon` API.

### Why SSE?

First for personal experimentation: I've already worked with `websocket`, never with `Server Sent Events`.  
It's also lighter to implement: no need to build a protocol, it's all text and ready to go.  
No need for binary data: the images will transit as `http` requests to be managed by the client app.

There's also a secret agenda: I'd like to experiment with `http2` multiplexing and see if **both** the long live request with the event stream and all other requests done by the app could share a unique underlying `TCP` connection. This might have no sens, being impossible by design, and I haven't spent any time on this. Still that was another motivation to experiment with `Server Sent Events`.

### Why a client package?

The `roon` API is highly connected: especially the content `browsing` and `loading` part.  
Each navigation session is isolated, and it's `state` is maintained by `roon`. You must provide a unique `multi_session_key` in your calls to indicate which session your making your navigation with.
There's no way to avoid this, it's the way it is.
So, it was clear, at early design stage, that I also needed to have a connected `API` while trying to keep as less `state` as possible in the `backend`.  

There were also the lifecycle of the `SSE` connection to manage.  
All the `events` are sent in the same `SSE` stream. On the other hand, for the application consuming the stream, it was better to isolate each `event` type.  
A [client](../packages/roon-web-client) was the best place to "demux" these events.

At the end, isolating this complexity in an abstraction layer was just making sens (both for development and for testing).

Finally, it was also a way to ease, for others, the development of their own `web application`: just fork the repo, remove the angular app, build what you want having this `client` as a dependency, copy the bundle in the appropriate folder during [CD](../.github/workflows/cd.yml) (see the step `Copy web app`), and you're good to go!

### Why Fastify?

Because `express` is deprecated, and I needed something else.

I had not followed what was happening on this part of the ecosystem, so I made a quick research on the new (actually not so new) alternatives.  

`Fastify` was checking all the boxes.

I especially liked the ability to `type` the different parts of the `API`, with the plugin architecture allowing to enrich the core api.

Once again, regarding the load the server part will have to deal with, any solution would have done the job.

This part is not tested, as `mocking` is a little complicated and the code itself is very straight-forward. Still, it should be done.

### Why node?

Because I had no incitation, regarding my use case, to spend time trying other `runtime`.  
Not a real choice, but, once again, the idea was **both** to learn and deliver.

### Why typescript?

Because typings... and, also, typings.

Have I mentioned that I **strongly** believe that **strongly typed** code is exponentially easier to maintain while any dimension of a code base grows (complexity, size, lifetime, number of devs, you name it...)?

`JSDoc` can be an alternative, but I've worked with `typescript` many times and didn't want to lose any time with unexpected caveats discovering how to type vanilla `JS` via `JSDoc`, seems I'll test this stack later ðŸ¤·. 

As `typescript` is also the standard for `Angular`, at the end, it just made sens to go with `typescript`.

### Why webpack?

The main reason is not a very good one: `webpack` was used by the last `frontend` tech lead/architect I worked with (I was his `backend` counterpart).  
He was genuinely good and passionate, told me about `tree shaking`, and, while coding `lambda` with the `stack` he had built (he was the subject-matter expert for `typescript/javascript`), I really appreciated the `import` auto-ordering that was making `mocking` in test so easy and transparent.  
I also appreciated the integration of `es-lint` and `prettier` in the build process, making `CI` way lighter.  
It was a good occasion for a personal, quick, crash course through the `webpack` doc.  
I'm not proud of the result, but it does the job I wanted it to do.  
Any `PR` demonstrating that it's not needed is welcome! Otherwise, it is very low in the `backlog`.

### Why the API is not an ES module?

The [client](../packages/roon-web-client) is an `ES module`, but yes, the [API](../app/roon-web-api) is not.

I've tried once, ended with a successful build but found a bunch of errors when launching the app...  
I then went back to my rule, this time even faster, and, after 30 minutes spent, kept the [API](../app/roon-web-api) the way it is: a `commonJS` `node` app.  
Except being stuck with an old version of `nanoid`, this has no effect on the final result. This `code` is not supposed to be consumed outside of this project.  
Any `PR` dealing with this situation is, once again, welcome! Otherwise, it is very low in the `backlog`.
